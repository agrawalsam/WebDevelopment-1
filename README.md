# WebDevelopment-1
This project attempts to enable a banking website for everyone. 
By everyone, it means even for physically disabled people and elderly people. 
For people, who are blind this project is also equiped with screen reader code. 
Screen Reader is a device which either uses braille or text to speech. This is very much helpful for blind people.
For elderly people, who have difficulty in reading what is written in webpage they can change font-size, line-spacing,
font-family and pictogram. While font-family and line-spacing are working properly, font-size and pictograms are 
under-development. For people filling login page sign language videos are enabled on hover(moving mouse pointer over it) so 
that people can understand if they are dumb.
